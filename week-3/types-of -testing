## Types of software testing

## Unit testing
### We've done it before :)
 * testing the smallest testable parts of an application - **units**
 * units are **isolated** from the rest of the code
 * units are examined to determine whether it behaves **exactly as you expect**

## Unit testing
### Example

## Integration tests
### Testing your units as a group!

* testing the **connection points** between separate groups of code
* can access API, databases, etc.
* will find bugs that unit tests can't 
* Can use the same frameworks as Unit testing
* There are disadvantages, too :( 
  * touch more code 
  * therefore failures are harder to diagnose 
  * and tests are harder to maintain

## End to end testing (aka Functional)
### Testing a complete functionality

* is done from the **perspective of the user**
  * interacting with the app the same way the user will be
* special tools are used to automate browsers (**Selenium**)
* **expensive to perform** and can be hard to maintain when they're automated
* it is recommended to have a few key end-to-end tests and mostly **rely more on lower level types** of testing

## End to end testing
### Example - searching for a certain phrase in Google

## But how much of each test types should we use?
### Common reco: 70% unit tests, 20% integration tests, and 10% end-to-end tests
The exact mix will be different for each team, but in general, it **should retain that pyramid shape**

### Regression Testing


Regression Testing is defined as a type of software testing to confirm that a recent program or code change has not adversely affected existing features.
